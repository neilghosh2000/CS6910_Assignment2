# CS6910_Assignment2

The description of the different files in the repository are as follows:

Part A

1. best_model - Contains the saved weights of the best model obtained after training.
2. wandb - Contains the local files of the all runs performed on wandb.
3. partA.ipynb - Final .ipynb for part A which can be executed cell by cell.
4. sweep.yaml - Contains the hyperparameter values to run the sweep in wandb for Part A.
5. train.py - Similar to the .ipynb file but in .py format

The weights of the best model - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OhekERA1Agk8viUKBFEwt1EzyACBi07K?usp=sharing

Best results for Part A - Training Accuracy = 0.5949, Train Loss = 1.183, Validation Accuracy = 0.3984, Validation Loss = 1.998

Part B

1. CS6910_Assignment_2_PartB.ipynb - Final .ipynb for part B which can be executed cell by cell.
2. sweep_part_B.yaml -  Contains the hyperparameter values to run the sweep in wandb for Part B.
3. train_part_B.yaml - Similar to the .ipynb file but in .py format

The weights of the best model - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TGIzIxvRy0BjUWPc4WDkTo_TeV66X6gJ?usp=sharing

Best results for Part B - Training Accuracy = 0.6908, Train Loss = 0.9443, Validation Accuracy = 0.6326, Validation Loss = 1.377


Part C

1. The PartC.ipynb file has the detailed that I have used to do real time object identification using Yolov3.
2. The folder also has the pre trained weights that I have used.
3. The source of the weights is a GitHub repository that I have mentioned in the report.
